This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in TypeScript related to type inference with the Date object's toDateString() method.  The original code is in `bug.ts`. The solution is found in `bugSolution.ts`, which addresses potential type mismatches for a more robust string representation.  The issue highlights how seemingly simple operations can have unexpected type-related consequences and emphasizes defensive programming.
